## Bio

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the chemical physics group at the Pacific Northwest National Laborotary. My work involves the development of electronic structure theory methods and the application of electronic structure on various applications of chemical and biological importance. 

## Education

PhD in Physical Chemistry | Iowa State University 2014 - 2019

BS in Biochemistry | Kutztown University 2010-2014 

## Experience

**Pacific Northwest National Laboratory** [2021 - Present]

*Topics*: Solvated electron, excited states in squaraines, platinum clusters and surfaces, MBE for metals, machine learning

**University of Colorado, Denver** [2019-2021]

*Topics*: adaptive partitioning schemes, semi-empirical methods, thiol-protected gold nanoclusters, software development in GAMESS

**Iowa State University** [2014-2019]

*Topics*: excited states, spin-flip method development, gold clusters, DFT/TDDFT, software development in GAMESS.
